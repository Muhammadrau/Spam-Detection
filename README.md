# Spam Detection using Machine Learning

##  Project Overview  
This project builds a spam message detection system using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning techniques. The model classifies text messages or emails as **Spam** or **Not Spam (Ham)** based on their content.

## Objectives  
- Preprocess and clean text data  
- Convert text into numerical features using vectorization techniques  
- Train and evaluate machine learning classification models  
- Accurately detect spam messages  

## Technologies Used  
- Python  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- NLTK  
- Scikit-learn  
- CountVectorizer / TF-IDF  
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
